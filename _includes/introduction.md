# Opus Group Composers' Club

The U.S. Digital Services Playbook defines strategies, called plays, to increase the success of federal software development projects.

Our team, the Opus Group Composers' Club, is a group of software developers that already implement many of these strategies. The purpose of this website is to catalogue our software development process in the context of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook.
