A synopsis


#### Agile First
As an agile company, our goal is to deliver the best product possible.  By the nature of agile delivery, to educate all stakeholders on the criticality of their involvement throughout the development process.  The best products are not created in a silos, but instead are refined overtime as the team adjusts to feedback.  Therefore understanding what people need is less of an act that occurs  at the beginning of a project and more so a constant evolving act.

#### Surveys
Surveys are critical to quickly gaining an understanding of how  organizations behave in relation to a problem.  While not a complete solution, they are the most effective unobtrusive method for interaction with the possible entire user base.

- Identify a Survey Tool.

#### User Focus Groups



#### Clear Project Roadmap








#### Automated Deployments

By default, we use the public AWS service to test our products and only use products available on the [AWS GovCloud service](http://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/)



We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

#### checklist
1. Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
2. Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
3. Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
4. Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
5. Share findings with the team and agency leadership
6. Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as "user stories"
7. As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs

#### key questions
- Who are your primary users? How often are you testing with real people?

<p class='opus_note'>
Government agencies<br>
^ Perhaps develop an open source survey tool?
</p>

- What user needs will this service address?
- Why does the user want or need this service?
- Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?

<p class='opus_note'>^ Section 508 compliance</p>
- Which research methods were used? What were the key findings?
- How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
